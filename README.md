## Description
A click and collect coordination app. 
This is attempt number 5 at creating this app. Going to use typescript and the MERN stack
This app is designed to replace several google sheets which are used to coordinate tasks and data flow between a central ecommerce location and 7 shop front locations.

## Tech
MERN stack and Typescript
I wanted to use IBM's carbon UI kit but at the time, they did not support react 18. Instead I'll use tailwind


## How to run
You'll need to have your ip address added to the database whitelist if you want to interact with it. Otherwise, there is a dummydata file that could be used.

1. clone the repo
2. cd frontend && npm i
3. cd backend && npm i

then either in the frontend folder or backend folder run (this will concurrently run the server and frontend)
4. npm run dev


## Challeneges 
TODO (Burnout, UI design and cors)
