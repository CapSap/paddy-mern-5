## Description
A click and collect coordination app. 
This is attempt number 5 at creating this app. Going to use typescript and the MERN stack
This app is designed to replace several google sheets which are used to coordinate tasks and data flow between a central ecommerce location and 7 shop front locations.

## Tech
MERN stack and Typescript
I wanted to use IBM's carbon UI kit but at the time, they did not support react 18. Instead I'll use tailwind


## How to run
-todo

## Challeneges 
TODO (Burnout, UI design and cors)
